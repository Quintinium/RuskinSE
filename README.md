Team Quintinium - Ruskin Search Project
=====

Welcome to the GitHub repository for team Quintinium's Ruskin search project! We are a team of students at SELU (Southeastern Louisiana University) taking Computer Science 285, Software Engineering. Students taking this course work together in groups and gain real-world experience with the Agile software development process by partaking in a collaborative software engineering project. Our group, Team Quintinium, has chosen the Ruskin search project.

What the Ruskin search project is:
-----
The Ruskin search project aims to provide full search functionality for the Ruskin website, which is maintained by SELU's English department. The Ruskin website was originally created by Dr. David Hanson, head of SELU's English department. The purpose of the Ruskin website is to provide a vast collection of scholarly material surrounding the early literary works of the author John Ruskin as he and his family traveled throughout Europe. Not only are there transcribed versions of Ruskin's original journals, but there are also a number of scholarly essays available. This only begins to describe the vast contents of the Ruskin site. Team Quintinium's "search project" is to provide a user-friendly search engine for this variety of content, allowing users of the Ruskin website to effortlessly locate important people, places, and works regarding John Ruskin. We will be integrating this search engine into the SELU English Department's existing Ruskin website.
