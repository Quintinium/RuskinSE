It is equally possible, however, that the sequence of composition was what it appears to be, \r\n                            but that the abrupt shifts between prose and poetry provide a clue about the process of fair&#x2010;copying \r\n                            (provided that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> had begun work in <ref type="witness" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_msix.php">MS IX</ref> by this point). \r\n                            In the fair copy of this prose passage for <ref type="witness" target="brussels_prose_msix.php">&#x201C;Brussels&#x201D;</ref>, \r\n                            a line of text ends with the break&#x2010;point in the draft, &#x201C;circumnavigating for&#x201D;&#x2014;with \r\n                            the &#x201C;for&#x201D; jammed against the justified right margin.

Finally, the speaker parodies a guidebook&#x02BC;s art and artifact tour \r\n                            of the cathedral. Perhaps <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> chose &#x201C;Aix la Chapelle&#x201D; as an exercise in condensation in order to signify the city&#x02BC;s pivotal geographical position \r\n                            at the juncture of <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</placeName>, and <placeName corresp="#GERMANY">Germany</placeName>, and the its distinctive, imperial status.</p>\r\n                        <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> carries out the principle of elaborating <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s pattern to its fullest in the sections on &#x201C;Andernacht,&#x201D; \r\n                            &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein,&#x201D; and &#x201C;St. Goar.&#x201D; The outer sections of the trio work as contrasts&#x2014;the first, gothic in mode; and the third, domestic. Between them, \r\n                            &#x201C;Ehrenbreitstein&#x201D; plays with the topic of confluence, as the meeting point of the darkly gothic and of sunny domesticity, symbolized by the meeting point \r\n                            of the <geogName corresp="#RHINE">Rhine River</geogName> and the <geogName corresp="#MOSELLE">Moselle River</geogName>.

It will be of extreme\r\n                    value to me in filling up what gaps I can in this patched coverlid of my life,\r\n                    before it is draped over my coffin&#x2014;if it may be. I am especially glad to\r\n                    have note of the letters to newspapers.&#x201D; These letters are printed as\r\n                    loose inserts included with the second edition, at least as found in the Ruskin\r\n                    Library&#x02BC;s copy, but various evidence confirms that the letters did originally\r\n                    belong to that edition.<note>The American edition, published by Wiley<!--Which Wiley?

In both the <placeName corresp="#USA">American</placeName> and the <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">British</placeName> second editions, this\r\n                        letter is prefaced by the explanation: "The Compiler of this Bibliography\r\n                        has had the honour to receive, in acknowledgment of a copy which he sent to\r\n                        <placeName corresp="#BRANTWOOD">Brantwood</placeName>, the following letter from <persName corresp="#JR">Mr. Ruskin</persName>." The second letter, as\r\n                        suggested by its <date when="1878-10-23">23 October 1878</date> date, may likewise have accompanied the\r\n                        second edition; however, the origin of its separate printed card is unclear.\r\n                        The Bodleian Library copy of the second edition, as shown online in Google\r\n                        Books, includes only the first <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> letter.</note> It is no accident,\r\n                    therefore, that the second edition carried <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> name in print, as did the\r\n                    fourth, which likewise involved self&#x2010;advertisement using <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> letters (see\r\n                    below).</p> \r\n                <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> comment in the October letter about his interest in &#x201C;the letters to newspapers&#x201D; refers to a particular interest of <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName>. In the introduction to the first edition of the bibliography, \r\n                    <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> expressed his special solicitude to track down the public letters, and the second edition does \r\n                    contain additional entries of this kind.

The list printed at the back of the <persName corresp="#CJHD">Dickens</persName> bibliography advertises specifically the fourth edition \r\n                        of the bibliography, which is the one other edition besides the second to bear <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd&#x02BC;s</persName> name in print.</note></p>\r\n                <p>In each edition of the bibliography except the last, which drops the author&#x02BC;s introduction, <persName corresp="#RHS">Shepherd</persName> dwells on his care: &#x201C;the materials for [the bibliography&#x02BC;s] compilation have taken many years to collect, \r\n                    and much anxious labour has been spent on its preparation and arrangement. No entry has in any case been made at second&#x2010;hand; but always with the actual book, pamphlet,\r\n                    magazine, or journal described lying before the compiler.&#x201D; Indeed, the thoroughness of Shepherd&#x02BC;s sleuthing is impressive. Entries on <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> early publications are in some cases annotated \r\n                    with quotations identifying or legitimating the piece.

These goals led to collectors&#x02BC; competitive search for\r\n                        rare books (causing a rise in market prices). The juvenilia and youthful writing\r\n                        of modern authors&#x2014;what were called <hi rend="italic">early editions</hi>&#x2014;acquired a cachet owing to their extreme scarcity. This\r\n                        goal of comprehensiveness in collecting was controversial, as collectors appeared to place\r\n                        exaggerated value on an author&#x02BC;s minor works. Publishers were suspected of\r\n                        encouraging an interest in juvenilia, since the desire could be met with\r\n                        reprints of works that were out of copyright or appeared to be neglected. Yet, despite these competitive incentives and keenness for the hunt, another\r\n                        significant motivation for collectors&#x02BC; interest in youthful writing lay in a &#x201C;sentiment&#x201D;\r\n                        strongly attached to these early editions in their original condition, and to juvenilia in particular. This sentiment likewise proved fraught and\r\n                        controversial.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>In historical accounts of the <date notBefore="1880-06-20" notAfter="1901-01-22">late&#x2010;Victorian</date> collecting of modern authors, \r\n                        the less savory, competitive motivations of collectors were foregrounded, \r\n                        because these motivations were blamed for creating opportunities for literary forgers.

Another cause of\r\n                        collectors&#x02BC; sentiment for original condition was the interest in tracing textual revisions by favorite modern\r\n                        authors through successive editions&#x2014;a scholarly attraction prompted by a tendency of some \r\n                        modern writers, such as <persName corresp="#ALT">Tennyson</persName>, to publish successive, revised versions of their work \r\n                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#EARLYEDITIONS">Slater, <title type="book" corresp="#EARLYEDITIONS" rend="italic">Early Editions</title></ref>, v&#x2013;vii; \r\n                        see also <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SLATERROMANCE">Slater, <title type="book" corresp="#SLATERROMANCE" rend="italic">Romance of Book&#x2010;Collecting</title></ref>, 118&#x2013;19). In describing the\r\n                        latter motivation, <persName corresp="#JHS">Slater</persName> does reflect a sentimentality in <persName corresp="#JC">Carter</persName> and\r\n                        <persName corresp="#HGP">Pollard</persName>&#x02BC;s sense of the collector&#x02BC;s imaginary closeness to the life\r\n                        of a favorite author.

For example, a date of &#x201C;<date when="1828-01-01">1 January 1828</date>&#x201D; that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inscribed on a\r\n                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="new_years_poems_note.php">New Year&#x02BC;s Poem</ref> refers obviously to the occasion of the fair copy&#x02BC;s presentation, \r\n                    and <date when="1828-01-01">1 January 1828</date> is used to index the poem in the archive. In such an instance, as the discussion of a work will clarify, however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would typically have drafted and fair&#x2010;copied\r\n                    the poem in <date notBefore="1827-12-01" notAfter="1827-12-31">December 1827</date>.</p>\r\n                <p>For indexing purposes, less credence is apt to be awarded to dates inscribed in the manuscript by later hands&#x2014;typically by\r\n                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="wedderburn_note.php"><persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> (d. <date when="1931">1931</date>)</ref> \r\n                    or <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W.

If these dates are questionable, \r\n                    the inscription is merely mentioned and discussed in the &#x201C;Date&#x201D; section.</p>\r\n                <p>In some cases, even dates that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself inscribed can be very misleading. For example, he dated several poems in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref> \r\n                    as <date when="1829-03-09">9 March 1829</date>. He is unlikely to have composed, or even fair&#x2010;copied, so many poems in a single day. This may be a case in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s inscription of a date \r\n                    refers, rather, to a wished&#x2010;for date of fair&#x2010;copying, a performative episode turning on tensions arising from his parents&#x02BC; attempts to control his writing, \r\n                    in conflict with his ardent desire to please them with his compositions \r\n                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="of_rocks_first_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION.php">&#x201C;Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing&#x201D;: Discussion</ref>).</p>\r\n                <p>The compositional date is given&#x2014;and the piece is ordered sequentially\r\n                    within a given year, according to that date&#x2014;only when a datable\r\n                    rough draft or some other hard evidence about its composition is available. In\r\n                    cases for which only the fair copy remains, one may often assume only a few\r\n                    months, at most, to have elapsed between beginning composition and\r\n                    fair&#x2010;copying.

Moreover, according to autobiographical accounts in <title type="book" corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title> \r\n                            and <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, the prose that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> intended as representative of his vocation \r\n                            was not the poetic prose of his youth, but the allegedly more analytical and plain prose of later years. This account of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s \r\n                            genres is faithfully reflected in fin&#x2010;de&#x2010;si&#x00E8;cle biographical and editorial projects, even \r\n                            at the cost of distorting facts, such as <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName>&#x02BC;s insistence that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                            started his professional writing life by having first published scientific prose, and not poetry, \r\n                            although <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> definitely knew the opposite to be the truth (see \r\n                            <ref type="apparatus" target="on_skiddaw_and_derwentwater_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><title type="poem" corresp="#JRONSKIDDAWANDDERWENTWATER">&#x201C;On Skiddaw and Derwent Water&#x201D;</title>: Composition and Publication</ref>).</p>\r\n                        <p>In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, rather than perpetuating the late&#x2010;century conceptualization of the early manuscripts in terms of a vocational watershed, \r\n                            the archive is organized around the creatively dynamic tension that is perceivable throughout the early writing&#x2014;the tension, namely, \r\n                            between the unitary work and the larger anthology or collection containing it. In the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref> \r\n                            of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1829">1820s</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                            projected his prose compositions as &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; in an ongoing multi&#x2010;volume series, while filling out each of these &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; \r\n                            with poems collected into small anthologies. Eventually, he developed unitary works as multi&#x2010;genre anthologies in themselves, \r\n                            as in the <ref type="apparatus" target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php">Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref> \r\n                            of <date notBefore="1833" notAfter="1834">1833&#x2013;34</date>, which he designed initially as a travelogue solely in verse, \r\n                            but then re&#x2010;conceived as a composite&#x2010;genre travelogue in verse, prose, and picture. \r\n                            In his youth, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was interested more in the dynamic relation of poetry and prose than in their separation. \r\n                            At the same time, it is also true, alongside these increasingly complex and lengthy composite projects, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> observed \r\n                            the generic boundaries of some poetic, scientific, and theological manuscripts of the mid&#x2010;1830s onward. Inevitably, in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, \r\n                            the organization of the archive into Work Pages and Manuscript Pages tends to dispel some of these tensions even as the plan attempts to represent \r\n                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s compositional practices.

\r\n                            In terms of <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup, both corpora and manuscripts are enclosed by the same &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; element. \r\n                            The slippage of one category into the other reflects <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s \r\n                            own dynamic process of containment and expansion. He was even apt at times, like <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName>, to think of the entirety \r\n                            of his &#x201C;works&#x201D; as a single corpus, as suggested by an annotation on \r\n                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSII">MS II</title></ref>.</p>\r\n                        <p>A more conventional way of representing anthologies in <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup is to enclose multiple, related texts with the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element. \r\n                            Since this element can nest only within a &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; document, \r\n                            and unlike &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; cannot itself contain a &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; document, \r\n                            the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element is too inflexible to accommodate <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s design for both single works and corpora or manuscripts. \r\n                            Single works are represented by multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents&#x2014;typically, an apparatus, multiple witnesses and facsimiles, and glosses&#x2014;while \r\n                            corpora and manuscripts are also represented by multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents, including an apparatus plus the sequence of works comprised by the collection \r\n                            (each work again consisting of its multiple &#x3008;TEI&#x3009; documents). An advantage that the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element holds over &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; \r\n                            is that the former is designed to accommodate a &#x3008;head&#x3009; element, which would more satisfyingly encode the title, \r\n                            <title type="anthology" corresp="#MSIPOETRYANTHOLOGY">&#x201C;Poetry&#x201D; [MS I Poetry Anthology]</title>, than what is shown in the sample markup above. \r\n                            Instead, using &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009;, either one must attach the anthology title as a &#x3008;head&#x3009; to the germane witness of the first item in the anthology, \r\n                            which is badly formed markup; or, as we have done above, one must insert the title as a separate <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> document. Arguably, however, \r\n                            the latter procedure is as well&#x2010;formed as it is valid in the frequent cases in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s titles and title pages \r\n                            refuse to conform to the structures that the &#x3008;group&#x3009; element was designed to describe. The &#x3008;teiCorpus&#x3009; element more flexibly \r\n                            accounts for <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s dynamic play with the relation between container and contained.</p>\r\n                        <p>For example, in the originally blank, pre&#x2010;bound notebook that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> named \r\n                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php"><title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSI">MS I</title></ref>, \r\n                            and that the Ruskin family knew as one of the <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Books</ref>, \r\n                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> used the inside front endboard to make a title page for a text, \r\n                            <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</title></ref>, \r\n                            possibly intending the work, at least initially, to be coextensive with the entirety of the physical notebook \r\n                            (see <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php#TITLE"><title type="lesson" corresp="#JRHARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</title>: Title</ref>, and \r\n                            <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php#TITLE">MS I: Title</ref>).

For example, in order to justify his hand&#x2010;printed text with the right margin, as in a printed book, \r\n                            he invented an end&#x2010;of&#x2010;line mark that resembles a hyphen, but that varies in length according to what is needed to fill out the physical measure of a line \r\n                            of text. To encode this mark as a hyphen would be misleading, whereas to ignore the mark altogether would be implicitly to assert that the materiality \r\n                            of text has no bearing on how we study and think about the youthful productions of nineteenth&#x2010;century authors.

First, the class of manuscripts that derive authority from both their polished presentation and their confidential status \r\n                            suggests that readers perceived authority in the material artifact itself, which bore direct witness to the authority of the writer&#x2014;or \r\n                            of something about the writer. &#x201C;I let <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>s letters come just as he writes them,&#x201D; <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> explained to <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> when enclosing their son&#x02BC;s letters inside her own, \r\n                            &#x201C;that you may not be misled in your judgment as to his hopes and feelings&#x201D; \r\n                            (<date when="1829-03-04">4 March 1829</date>, in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 1:185). \r\n                            <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> assumes a Romantic idea about writing as an open window to the writer&#x02BC;s expression, which if copied in her own hand \r\n                            would not only lose authority, but even potentially mislead the reader. \r\n                            There do survive copies of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s works in his parents&#x02BC; hands, but these are far less common than <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s own fair copies; \r\n                            and it seems unlikely that what <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> wanted the Grays to &#x201C;see&#x201D;&#x2014;not just read&#x2014;would have been a fair copy in her own hand, \r\n                            which derived authority from her adult sophistication of punctuation, spelling, orthography, and the like. \r\n                            Rather, &#x201C;judgment as to [the child writer&#x02BC;s] hopes and feelings&#x201D; derived from an intimate experience and knowledge that were available \r\n                            only through the authoritative original artifact; and by virtue of the artifact&#x02BC;s materiality, \r\n                            this experience could be extended to a trusted confidential circle.</p>\r\n                        <p>Evidence suggests that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> shared this sense of an intended confidential audience that, in <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName>&#x02BC;s defintion, \r\n                            was most likely &#x201C;personally known to or interested in the author.&#x201D;  \r\n                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s understanding of these conditions is indicated by his inclusion of a letter to the Grays&#x02BC; relation, \r\n                            <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="monro_robert_mrs_note.php">Mrs. Robert Monro</ref>, \r\n                            as part of <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus.php">MS II</ref>, a manuscript that he entitled &#x201C;vol 1&#x201D; of his &#x201C;Works.&#x201D; \r\n                            By including a letter to <persName corresp="#MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</persName> as part of the handsewn pamphlet, which otherwise contains poems, \r\n                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears implicitly to invite <persName corresp="#MONROROBERTMRS">Mrs. Monro</persName> to form part his confidential audience beyond the immediate family circle. \r\n                            The designation &#x201C;Works,&#x201D; moreover, attests to the significance of this production, both as a physical thing, a &#x201C;volume,&#x201D; \r\n                            and as an abstract promise of more to come.</p>\r\n                        <p>It follows that, as an editorial procedure appropriate to a manuscript&#x02BC;s classification as a polished confidential production, \r\n                            an edition of <date notBefore="1801" notAfter="1900">nineteenth&#x2010;century</date> juvenilia should include, as does <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, manuscript images; \r\n                            diplomatic, and not eclectic or otherwise &#x201C;corrected&#x201D; transcriptions of texts; \r\n                            and a thorough physical description of the manuscript.

Nonetheless this materiality retained its value \r\n                            primarily among collectors and did not affect the the editor&#x02BC;s mission to improve the texts for a modern, anonymous audience.</p>\r\n                        <p>In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> studies, thinking about distinctions between the private, confidential, and public in his manuscripts \r\n                            is complicated by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s invitation to view his writing as a window to his whole mind, an invitation rendered \r\n                            paradoxical by his simultaneous insistence on the Carlylean &#x201C;strength&#x201D; required to resist the pathetic fallacy. \r\n                            Famously, in <title corresp="#JRFORS"><hi rend="italic">Fors Clavigera</hi></title>, his open letters to &#x201C;workers,&#x201D; \r\n                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> declared that his private letters could be read aloud from the housetops: &#x201C;I never wrote a letter in my life \r\n                            which all the world are not welcome to read, if they will&#x201D; (letter 59); or, as he expressed the idea more colorfully to the artist, \r\n                            <persName corresp="JSARTIST">James Smetham</persName> (1821&#x2013;89): &#x201C;I never wrote a private letter to any human being \r\n                            which I would not let a bill&#x2010;sticker chalk up six feet high on <placeName corresp="#HYDEPARK">Hyde Park</placeName> wall, \r\n                            and stand myself in <placeName corresp="#PICCADILLY">Piccadilly</placeName> and say &#x2018;I said it&#x2019;&#x201D; \r\n                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 28:449, 14:462). \r\n                            Looking to the juvenilia for the origins of this position, one wonders if this reckless intimacy was born of necessity, \r\n                            since <persName corresp="#JJR">John James Ruskin</persName> carried samples of <persName corresp="#JR">John</persName>&#x02BC;s letters on \r\n                            his travels, perhaps ready to show them to any interested stranger. We can only speculate about such causes, but the result seems to have been a collapsing \r\n                            of private, confidential, and public into a single category, whether in his youthful or mature writing. The difference between the juvenilia and mature writing is that, \r\n                            whereas one can usefully parse the mature writing in terms of <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName>&#x02BC;s distinctions based on authorial intentions about audience,\r\n                            and yet trace a commonality of autobiographical impulse connecting these differing kinds of works, the whole span of youthful writing seems almost indistinguishable \r\n                            in terms of authorial intention about <hi rend="italic">audience</hi>, while an autobiographical register is typically (albeit not universally, in all works) \r\n                            submerged below the level of detectable intention. In the manuscripts of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s mature writing, \r\n                            readers tend to look for private emotion universally, even when these manuscripts can be logically and usefully \r\n                            sorted as private, confidential, and public; in the early writing, readers are presented with a wide range of theatrical, performative emotion, \r\n                            but private emotion is much less easily detectable as an intention and must be read by the other means that <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> \r\n                            believes to be misleading for distinguishing the public or confidential from the public&#x2014;the rhetoric of the work, and the depth of the writer&#x02BC;s relation to the person addressed.</p>\r\n                        <p>As <persName corresp="#RBRETON">Rob Breton</persName> remarks, much of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s &#x201C;early verse is notable for its emotional distance and detachment, \r\n                            despite the intimate, spontaneous, garrulous personae of the poet and the clear imitation of and inspiration from Romantic writing&#x201D;&#x2014;a quality \r\n                            of detachment consistent with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s later theory of the pathetic fallacy. If in its &#x201C;refusal of emotion&#x201D; \r\n                            the early writing nonetheless points also to suppression of &#x201C;pychological burdens,&#x201D; \r\n                            then the writing often points to those burdens only in terms of their having been &#x201C;duly evaded.&#x201D; \r\n                            Yet <persName corresp="#RBRETON">Breton</persName> also observes that the detached quality of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s \r\n                            early writing &#x201C;complements&#x201D; an investigation into an opposite tendency in the youthful writing&#x2014;namely, \r\n                            the existence of private &#x201C;signs of &#x2018;psychological disturbance&#x2019;&#x201D; \r\n                            that, according to <persName corresp="#DCH">David Hanson</persName>&#x02BC;s reading, were &#x201C;likely caused by his mother&#x02BC;s disapproval of her son&#x02BC;s &#x2018;romantic&#x2019; instincts and devotion to poetry.&#x201D; \r\n                            It is unlikely that one can coordinate these opposite modes of expression&#x2014;private anger and resentment, and public detachment&#x2014;reliably with authorial intention \r\n                            respecting private, confidential, and public audience, since most pieces will appear to adopt the detachment appropriate to an imagined public \r\n                            (i.e., what <persName corresp="#DHR">Reiman</persName> terms &#x201C;polished&#x201D; confidential manuscripts). \r\n                            It is true that signs of psychological disturbance seems to emerge more consistently in rough&#x2010;draft works than in \r\n                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts, \r\n                            but we do not know to what extent <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> kept the rough&#x2010;draft notebooks private. \r\n                            The presence of his father&#x02BC;s hand marking some drafts suggests that these notebooks were never secret. \r\n                            Ruskin&#x02BC;s intentions, therefore, will seem all but uniformly to point in the direction of &#x201C;polished&#x201D; confidentiality, \r\n                            as in much nineteenth&#x2010;century juvenilia, while proving a deceptive indicator of the emotional bearings of a work. \r\n                            Private emotion that jars with an intention of public address (or the imitation of public address) is more likely to be signaled by rhetorical or accidental features \r\n                            such as fragmentation.

In <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s case, some works explicitly concern \r\n                            emotional relations with one parent or the other, as in <ref type="apparatus" target="on_papas_leaving_home_apparatus.php">&#x201C;On Papat&#x02BC;s Leaving Home&#x201D;</ref>, \r\n                            and I have argued in <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HANSONSELFANDREVISION">&#x201C;Self and Revision in Ruskin&#x02BC;s Revaluations of Romanticism&#x201D;</ref>, \r\n                            for example, that some works can be explained as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s angry response to his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s \r\n                            attempts to stem his poetry writing.

For some, \r\n                                this difficulty only justifies their low opinion of juvenilia studies, but these exclusionary policies often carry a hidden agenda that proves \r\n                                at least as interesting historically as the allegedly minor writing that such policies disqualify for serious study. \r\n                                <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> believed that the scope of materials included in the <title type="book" corresp="#JRWORKSLE">Library Edition</title> \r\n                                was determined by the guarded decorum of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s inner circle&#x2014;a policy, namely, \r\n                                that &#x201C;nothing should be made public which might reflect adversely, from [the editors&#x02BC;] point of view, \r\n                                either upon <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> or upon any member of the family&#x201D;; and also (and potentially contradictorily) that \r\n                                &#x201C;all that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> said autobiographically, especially in <title type="book" corresp="#JRPRAETERITA"><hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi></title>, \r\n                                about his life and that of his parents should be given unqualified editorial support&#x201D; \r\n                                (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCOTTISHHERITAGE">Viljoen, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Scottish Heritage</hi></ref>, 16&#x2013;17; and see \r\n                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, xxviii).

This procedure is noted where it occurs, \r\n                            with the expectation of later revisiting the physical manuscript.</p>\r\n                        <p>For support of archival research as well as imaging of the manuscripts, the editor and the Digital Humanities program at \r\n                            <orgName corresp="#SOUTHEASTERNU">Southeastern Louisiana University</orgName> are indebted to the agencies listed on the \r\n                            <ref type="webpage" target="staff.php">Staff and Support</ref> page. Without the travel grants and fellowships awarded by these agencies, \r\n                            the research underpinning <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> would not have been possible. The editor is also grateful to the staffs of these libraries and archives, \r\n                            who shared their expertise and supported our research.</p>\r\n                        <p>In the earliest stage of developing the digital archive beyond the research and writing, <persName corresp="#RGARSIDE">Roger Garside</persName>, \r\n                            formerly senior lecturer in the <orgName corresp="#LANCASTERUCOMPUTING">Department of Computing, Lancaster University</orgName>,\r\n                            devised a helpful program for translating the editor&#x02BC;s word processing files into lightly <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName>&#x2010;encoded \r\n                            <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title>, and for generating transformations in the form of <title type="program" corresp="#HTML">HTML</title> pages. \r\n                            This program was subsequently replaced as we elaborated our ideas about describing the early <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> manuscripts \r\n                            with <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> markup, and also as we pursued a pedagogy for introducing students to <orgName corresp="#TEI">TEI</orgName> \r\n                            encoding and to designing and building online scholarly resources. <persName corresp="#RGARSIDE">Garside</persName>&#x02BC;s program, however, \r\n                            was foundational for helping us to envision the architecture of the archive. Meanwhile, to advance the Digital Humanities program at \r\n                            <orgName corresp="#SOUTHEASTERNU">Southeastern Louisiana University</orgName>, we benefited from consultation by <persName corresp="#SBAUMAN">Syd Bauman</persName>, \r\n                            <persName corresp="#MCHRISTY">Matthew Christy</persName>, <persName corresp="#JFLANDERS">Julia Flanders</persName>, <persName corresp="#LMANDELL">Laura Mandell</persName>, \r\n                            <persName corresp="#DPARKER">Dot Porter</persName>, <persName corresp="#LWOOF">Lawrence Woof</persName>, and the staff of the <date when="2005">2005</date> \r\n                            <orgName corresp="#NINES">NINES</orgName> Summer Workshop in Digital Scholarship at the <orgName corresp="VIRGINIAU">University of Viriginia</orgName>. \r\n                            <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is indebted to these individuals and their institutions for their generosity and good will, \r\n                            which has persisted long beyond their respective workshops or consultations that got us started.</p>\r\n                        <p>In the ongoing addition of new files to the archive, the following routines are observed by the encoding team. First, using the <orgName corresp="#OXYGEN">SyncRO Soft Oxygen</orgName> XML editor, \r\n                            encoders pull the word&#x2010;processed files of the editor&#x02BC;s original transcript(s) of a work, along with files of his apparatus and other annotation, \r\n                            into appropriate templates built for the varying document types included in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. In a first pass, encoders mark up the editor&#x02BC;s original \r\n                            transcription and commentary according to the <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI P5</title> standard; and the encoder checks the editor&#x02BC;s original transcript \r\n                            against its manuscript facsimile, querying any possible inaccuracies. Team members are instructed to confirm transcription of every deliberate mark on a manuscript, \r\n                            in whatever hand. As <persName corresp="#DLVM">Vander Meulen</persName> and <persName corresp="#GTT">Tanselle</persName> comment: &#x201C;Obviously a transcription \r\n                            cannot exactly reproduce the relative precision or carelessness with which handwritten letters are formed, or their relative sizes, or the amount of space \r\n                            between words and lines; but it can aim to record every ink or pencil marking of textual significance on the manuscript&#x2014;all letters, punctuation, superscripts, \r\n                            canceled matter, lines linking or excising passages, and so on&#x201D; \r\n                            (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#VANDERMEULENTANSELLETRANSCRIPTION">&#x201C;System of Manuscript Transcription&#x201D;</ref>, 201). \r\n                            We consider this aim, and nothing less, as defining the standard for first&#x2010;pass conversion of the editor&#x02BC;s original files, \r\n                            and for checking or completing transcription against its facsimile at this first stage, because it is impractical and an invitation to oversight to reserve some \r\n                            portion of transcription for a later stage. One can and should review the accuracy and thoroughness of transcription as often as one likes, but no systematic \r\n                            procedure for dividing a thorough transcription into stages would be practical, since one would have to redefine the procedure constantly in order to address \r\n                            the peculiarities of each manuscript.</p>\r\n                        <p>To maintain consistency of markup in this process, the encoding team references a Encoding Guide, compiled by the supervising encoder, \r\n                            which lists every element, attribute, and value so far employed in the archive, and which is continually updated, as additional <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI</title> \r\n                            elements and attributes or <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> values are discussed and added by the team. The team also constantly references and updates \r\n                            a project&#x2010;based Regularization Guide, which is a <title type="program" corresp="#MSEXCEL">Microsoft Excel</title> spreadsheet listing every \r\n                            <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> file name by category&#x2014;the names, that is, of files in the document&#x2010;type categories of \r\n                            apparatuses, manuscripts, witnesses, anthologies, drawings, essays, notes, and glosses. The Regularization Guide also lists all standardized editorial titles \r\n                            for these entities; and it serves as the encoders&#x02BC; crib for hex&#x2010;codes for special characters, <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s xml:ids for all proper names, \r\n                            titles, and bibliography entries used in the archive, the names used to identify hands, and dates and date ranges used to mark historical events. \r\n                            The team (mainly, in this case, the editor and supervising encoder) continually updates the Regularization Guide as new works, manuscripts, and commentary are added to the archive.</p>\r\n                        <p>To manage workflow, the team uses the shared&#x2010;file system, <title type="program" corresp="#DROPBOX">Dropbox</title>, by <orgName corresp="#DROPBOXINC">Dropbox Incorporated</orgName>. \r\n                            Encoders work within their assigned <title type="program" corresp="#DROPBOX">Dropbox</title> folders, and for each <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> file \r\n                            they add their name and responsibility to the <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI P5</title> header. When ready for review by more experienced encoders, \r\n                            the <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> file is moved (not copied) from the encoder&#x02BC;s folder and into another folder, \r\n                            in order to guard against accidental confusion and overwriting of files. The editor examines first&#x2010;pass encoding for accuracy, consulting both his notes \r\n                            from on&#x2010;site archival research and the facsimile. After the editor has reviewed a file, it passes to the supervising encoder for a final check \r\n                            of consistency with the <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> Encoding Guide and Regularization Guide and for a review of other matters of well&#x2010;formedness and validation. \r\n                            Finally, when the files have undergone transformation by <title type="program" corresp="#XSLT">XSLT</title> (written by the supervising encoder) and have been loaded \r\n                            onto the site, the editor reviews the live Web pages to confirm that the transformations have yielded the desired result and to search for any remaining typographical or encoding errors.</p>\r\n                        <p>Not only is the team steadily adding new works and manuscripts to the archive, but also the editor is constantly researching and developing the commentary \r\n                            in apparatuses, notes, and glosses in order to increase the usefulness of the archive for researchers. At any given time, hyperlinks to notes are embedded \r\n                            in the <title type="program" corresp="#XML">XML</title> files that are presently inactive because the source notes are unfinished. \r\n                            When a source note is completed and added to the archive, any pre&#x2010;existing links to it should become active. All files are subject to revision and reloading \r\n                            with an appropriately updated version number.</p>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    \r\n                    <div type="subsection" xml:id="ELEMENT">\r\n                        <head type="subsection">Element, Attribute, and Value Usage</head>\r\n                        <p>See the Encoding Guide for lists of all elements and attributes used in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> along with their assigned values.</p>\r\n                        <p>Because editing in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is documentary, we transcribe without correction <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s (remarkably rare) \r\n                            misspellings and grammatical errors. Also, we retain his capitalizations, ampersands, and unhyphenated spaces in such words such as <hi rend="italic">to day</hi>, \r\n                            <hi rend="italic">every day</hi>, <hi rend="italic">every one</hi>, and so on. If <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> omits letters from words, \r\n                            he usually does so to serve poetic meter. Since the reader can in most cases compare the edited typescript against the facsimile, \r\n                            the cause of an apparent anomaly will be evident (e.g., doubled letters arising from dividing a word between lines, or doubled words occurring before and after page breaks); \r\n                            nonetheless, potentially confusing anomalies and other distinctive manuscript features receive discussion in a textual gloss. \r\n                            Some of the most anomalous and challenging markup decisions are presented by the earliest juvenilia, in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> invented his own \r\n                            solutions for representing the print culture surrounding him.</p>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div type="sub-subsection" xml:id="HAND">\r\n                            <head type="sub-subsection">Handwriting and Special Characters</head>\r\n                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s handwriting, like that of any youth, changes and develops steadily over the course of time. \r\n                                In the years comprised by <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, one can observe his handwriting evolve from print lettering to cursive, \r\n                                and from an awkward cursive to a skillful command of a range of lettering styles, including a &#x201C;copperplate&#x201D; hand reserved for \r\n                                fair&#x2010;copying. We can watch him exchange a graphite pencil for pen and ink, and we can even detect evidence of his using a slate, \r\n                                although all direct traces of that stage of composition have of course vanished. In his fair copies, we can compare his imitations of print typefaces \r\n                                against models found in a range of trends broadly characterizing English books of the late eighteenth and eary nineteenth centuries as well as against \r\n                                typographic innovations specific to the historic moment of the <date notBefore="1820" notAfter="1839">1820s through 1830s</date>.</p>\r\n                            <p>The <title type="program" corresp="#TEIP5">TEI P5</title> element used to establish the rudiments of these evolving skills, media, and cultural conditions \r\n                                is &#x3008;handShift&#x3009;, which carries attributes of &#x0040;script and &#x0040;medium, \r\n                                and to which we assign an xml:id based on the calendar year enclosing the manuscript in question&#x2014;the latter a somewhat arbitrary but functional organizing principle. \r\n                                For a detailed survey of these developments in and influences over <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s hand, see \r\n                                <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Handwriting</ref>.</p>\r\n                            <p>Where <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> imitates a special character in the style of a typeface, we highlight these using the &#x3008;hi&#x3009; element, \r\n                                with the &#x0040;rend value keyed to such special usages as &#x201C;doubleletter&#x201D; and &#x201C;doubleletter&#x2010;fill,&#x201CD;; \r\n                                see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="hand_note.php">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Handwriting</ref>.</p>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        \r\n                        <div type="sub-subsection" xml:id="JUSTIFICATION">\r\n                            <head type="sub-subsection">Justification, Runover, and Word Division</head>\r\n                            <p>As discussed in <ref type="internal" target="#MATERIALITY">Expressing the Materiality of the Manuscripts</ref>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                                invented a mark to justify right and left margins in fair&#x2010;copy prose, which saved him from having to adjust space between words in a line of text. \r\n                                To fill the gap to the margin, he inserted a horizontal mark of variable length (and sometimes of variable appearance, shaped like an equal sign or a tilde). \r\n                                Since it would misrepresent the mark&#x02BC;s purpose to encode it according to its appearance in length as a hyphen, en&#x2010;dash, or em&#x2010;dash, \r\n                                or some other symbol, we use a glyph element, assigning it a &#x0040;type &#x201C;justification&#x201D; \r\n                                as follows:<lb/>\r\n                                <lb/>\r\n                            <hi rend="center">&#x3008;g type&#x003D;&#x201C;justification&#x201D;&#x3009;-&#x3008;/g&#x3009;.</hi>\r\n                            <lb/></p>\r\n                            <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> often indicated paragraph breaks as minimally as possible. Whether because he meant to use space on a page efficiently, \r\n                                or because he liked the appearance of a more solid block of text, he often failed to indent a word beginning a new paragraph. The intention of a paragraph break \r\n                                can be signaled, despite the lack of indentation, by a significant gap between the end of a preceding line and the right margin, with no justification mark used \r\n                                to take up the slack. Sometimes, however, he fills such spaces with stars, like asterisks, and the following line still seems meant as a new paragraph. \r\n                                Signals become especially confusing when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> ends a block of text with a dash, which serves some rhetorical purpose \r\n                                such as an excited pause, and which would be indistinguishable from a justification mark apart from white space following it. In <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, \r\n                                therefore, we insert paragraph breaks in a text when both sense and some definite scribal feature&#x2014;such as significant space at the end of a preceding \r\n                                line, and/or a rare indentation at the start of the next line&#x2014;seem to call for a new paragraph.

In the first “Harry and Lucy” (no. 3), \r\n                            Ruskin ends sentences with a mark that might be a question mark or might be an exclamation point, \r\n                            and that seems to serve both of those functions. I have interpreted this mark similarly to my treatment of Ruskin’s comma and period reversal, \r\n                            using [?] for the mark when the sense calls for a question, and [!] for the mark in other cases.</p>\r\n                        <p>As another system of his own in the earlier writing, especially in no. 3, Ruskin added closing quotation marks only to the ends of paragraphs, \r\n                            never paired with opening quotation marks. Not all the paragraphs with closing quotation marks are dialogue, \r\n                            and not all dialogue paragraphs have quotation marks. I suspect either that Ruskin misunderstood the symbol as indicating the end of a paragraph, \r\n                            or that he just liked the mark’s appearance. In either case, the mark would be best omitted altogether in transcription; \r\n                            however, I have retained it, since another reader might make better sense of it.</p>\r\n                        <p>Still more bizarre is Ruskin’s doubled period, which he uses in the second “Harry and Lucy” (no. 20) and still more frequently in “Eudosia” (no. 27). \r\n                            The mark certainly does not indicate an emphatic stop; the opposite is more likely, a two-point ellipsis suggesting a slight pause, \r\n                            in the way a dash would normally be used. Ruskin may have needed to invent his own sign to function as a dash, \r\n                            since he used dashes and hyphens for another purpose, namely, to fill out and “justify” lines. \r\n                            In nos. 20 and 27, a bracketed dash [—] is used in place of Ruskin’s double period (..).\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        -->\r\n                    </div>\r\n                        <div type="sub-subsection" xml:id="DELETIONANDADDITION">\r\n                            <head type="sub-subsection">Deletion and Addition</head>\r\n                            <p>In the <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>&#x02BC;s Showcase display, deletions and additions are rendered as an approximation of a genetic text, \r\n                                such as that marked up (using typographical symbols) in \r\n                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#MELVILLEBILLYBUDD">Melville, <title type="book" corresp="#MELVILLEBILLYBUDD"><hi rend="italic">Billy Budd, Sailor</hi></title>, ed.

As the term implies, \r\n                                explanatory glosses contextualize specific passages in a work&#x2014;too specific to be annotated with a &#x3008;note&#x3009; that would be \r\n                                accessible by hyperlink througout the edition.

The callouts appear in a different color than \r\n                                that of the surrounding text; and explanatory gloss callouts are sequenced in arabic numerals, while textual gloss callouts are sequenced by lowercase letters.</p>\r\n                            <p>While it is typically recommended in print editions that such annotations be referenced by line number in order to maintain a clear text, \r\n                                without the clutter of note callouts (see, e.g., \r\n                                <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#KLINEPERDUEDOCUMENTARY">Kline and Perdue, <hi rend="italic">Guide to Documentary Editing</hi></ref>, 117), \r\n                                two factors render embedded callouts more practical in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>. First, because the archive preserves the separate integrity of multiple witnesses \r\n                                of a work, a gloss must be capable of hyperlinking to the same or similar string of characters found in more than one witness, \r\n                                without regard to differences between witnesses in line numbering.

As compared with softer copper, which soon lost its edge in repeated impressions, \r\n                        steel engraving made possible the mass production of images, and helped to satisfy the craving for pervasive, but affordable visual culture by the early&#x2010;Victorian middle class. \r\n                        These developments coincided with <persName corresp="#AE">Alexander Elder</persName>&#x02BC;s ambitions for <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi>.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p><orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi> benefited by these early, rapid developments in the annual as a commodity. \r\n                        Its binding was more sumptuous, and the engraving sharper and more consistent. At the same time, \r\n                        a comparison of <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName>&#x02BC;s product with the volumes published by the annual&#x02BC;s creator, <persName corresp="#LRPUBLISHER">Relfe</persName>, \r\n                        suggests that the new firm attempted to keep the interior uniform with earlier volumes, at least initially. \r\n                        <orgName corresp="#SMITHELDER">Smith, Elder</orgName> did expand the title, however, from <orgName corresp="#RELFE">Relfe</orgName>&#x02BC;s <title type="anthology" corresp="RELFEFRIENDSHIPSOFFERING"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album</hi></title> to \r\n                        <hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering: A Literary Album and Annual Remembrancer</hi>.  \r\n                        In <date when="1833">1833</date>, the title changed again, the annual having absorbed another existing publication, <hi rend="italic">Winter&#x02BC;s Wreath</hi>, \r\n                        which had been published in <placeName corresp="#LIVERPOOL">Liverpool</placeName> since <date when="1828">1828</date>.

At the same time, some rhetorical features of\r\n                    the earlier poem remain present in the later one, if not identically expressed, such as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s interest in relevant sizes and distances.

Erased earlier numbering remains\r\n                    visible starting on the present p. 21 (&#x201C;19&#x201D; is the erased\r\n                    number, an error since p. 19 had already appeared) and continuing consecutively\r\n                    through p. 49[<hi rend="italic">b</hi>] (i.e., the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>\r\n                    p. 49). Since the latter was written over top of &#x201C;47,&#x201D; it\r\n                    appears that, at about this point, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> realized an error, went back to the\r\n                    present p. 21, and began renumbering; however, he made some new errors and\r\n                    possibly deliberately repeated pp. 48&#x2013;49 in an attempt to bring his\r\n                    numbering in sync with following pages. The erratic numbering after p. 50\r\n                    appears to have resulted from <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> writing &#x201C;80&#x201D; for\r\n                    &#x201C;60,&#x201D; and carrying on without correction.

It appears that the deleted phrase originally formed part of a colophon that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> meant to apply only to the poetry anthology, \r\n                    but that, by deleting the phrase, he caused to refer to the entire Red Book, not just the\r\n                    poems (reading, in effect, &#x201C;The end / <placeName corresp="#HERNE">hernhill</placeName> / <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName> / juvenile library <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName>&#x201D;). Another, slightly different scenario is possible: the fact that the final two\r\n                    poems of the anthology fall after <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s annotation dating the whole of\r\n                    MS I may indicate that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> added these poems (on pp.\r\n                    103&#x2013;6) after his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s dating, and as he did so, he deleted &#x201C;end of\r\n                    the poems&#x201D; on p. 106 so as not to belie his addition. But this possibility seems contradicted by the placement of the colophon following all of the poems. \r\n                    It is also possible, of course, whatever the scenario, that the deletion was not made by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, but by someone\r\n                    else.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div type="subsection" xml:id="DOMESTICSCENE">\r\n                <head type="subsection">Domestic Scene</head>\r\n                <p>MS I is the only <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> to locate\r\n                    its imaginary publisher, the &#x201C;juvenile library,&#x201D; in\r\n                    &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#HERNE">hernhill</placeName> / <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName>,&#x201D; other Red Books mentioning simply <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref>. \r\n                    Could <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> be referring to what <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> records as an early memory, the water\r\n                    carts being filled in front of the house (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:21)?\r\n                    In <hi rend="italic">Praeterita,</hi> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> leaves unclear whether he observed\r\n                    the carts from the windows of <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Hern Hill</placeName> or of the <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="hunter_street_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HUNTERST">Hunter Street</placeName></ref>\r\n                    house&#x2014;where the family lived prior to <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, until <date when="1823-03">March 1823</date>\r\n                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINSCAMBERWELL">Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Camberwell</hi></ref>, 1).

At a certain point in section <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                            mixes the sequence of pieces for the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; with writing from <date notBefore="2011-03-20" notAfter="1834-06-21">Spring 1834</date> \r\n                            that is identifiable with other purposes, such celebrating <persName corresp="#JJR">John James&#x02BC;s</persName> birthday, and yet he does abandon the line numbering. Thus, the first portion of Contents, section <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, \r\n                            which appears devoted exclusively to the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; is designated section <hi rend="italic">b.1</hi>, while the stint that suddenly becomes miscellaneous is designated \r\n                            section <hi rend="italic">b.2</hi>\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>\r\n                            <list type="ordered" xml:id="LISTB1">\r\n                                <head>List <hi rend="italic">b</hi>.1</head>\r\n<!--Sample entry follows.

This larger pattern of composition and fair&#x2010;copying, overlapping with that for <ref type="apparatus"  target="msvi_apparatus.php">MS VI</ref>, is sustained throughout \r\n                            Contents, section <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, from <date notBefore="1831-09-22" notAfter="1831-12-21">fall 1831</date> through <date notBefore="1833-03-20" notAfter="1833-06-21">spring 1833</date>.</p>\r\n                        <p>A change in this pattern emerges when, in Contents, section <hi rend="italic">b</hi>, &#x201C;Athens&#x201D; is displaced as the principal long work \r\n                            by <ref type="apparatus"  target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php">Account of a Tour on the Continent</ref>. \r\n                            The pattern is maintained insofar as Ruskin probably fair&#x2010;copied &#x201C;The Account&#x201D; almost simultaneously, into <ref type="apparatus"  target="msix_apparatus.php">MS IX</ref>, \r\n                            but composition of &#x201C;The Account&#x201D; differs in taking over the notebook completely, from <date notBefore="1833-09-22" notAfter="1833-12-21">fall 1833</date> through spring and <date notBefore="1834-06-21" notAfter="1834-07-22">early summer 1834</date>. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> does not alternate brief stints of the longer work \r\n                            with composition of shorter lyrics, except to take up draft of occasional works, for which purpose he jumps ahead to an unused section (e.g., Contents, sections <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and \r\n                            <hi rend="italic">d</hi>. This change can be partly explained by the nature of the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; itself, which apparently evolved from an exclusively metrical topographical work \r\n                            into a compound genre, of poetry, prose, and illustration. Composition of the work entailed its own varying of interest and literary/artistic form.</p>\r\n                        <p>As explained in <ref type="apparatus"  target="account_of_a_tour_on_the_continent_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION">Account of a Tour on the Continent: Discussion</ref>, \r\n                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> modeled this anthology&#x2010;like approach to composing &#x201C;The Account&#x201D; on publications of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> that exhibit mixed forms dependent on new printing technologies&#x2014;for example, the \r\n                            topographical work, <hi rend="italc">Italy</hi>, by <persName corresp="#SR">Samuel Rogers</persName>, which <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName> republished as a popular illustrated book in <date when="1830">1830</date>, \r\n                            its large volume of production and wide distribution made possible by the new stee engraving. \r\n                            <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> was also imitating the prose writing typical of the illustrated landscape annuals of the period. \r\n                            Thus, in the &#x201C;Account&#x201D; section of MS VIII (section <hi rend="italic">b</hi>), <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                            might be understood as not so much as abandoning his earlier procedure of afternating draft of epic verse with draft of briefer lyrics, \r\n                            as finding and developing a model for a single project that accommodated his preference for varying genres. In this regard, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> simply aligns his existing compositional habits \r\n                            with features of publications of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date> aimed at the <placeName corresp="#BRITAIN">British</placeName> middle class, especially travel and ekphrastic publication.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>What must have been somewhat unexpected, however, and what wrenches the use of MS VIII away from the familiar pattern of <ref type="apparatus"  target="msvi_apparatus.php">MS VI</ref>, \r\n                            is that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself enters that publishing scene in 1834&#x2013;35 as the author, &#x201C;J.R.,&#x201D; \r\n                            when he becomes a contributor to <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="friendships_offering_note.php"><hi rend="italic">Friendship&#x02BC;s Offering</hi></ref>. \r\n                            That transition&#x2014;which was brought about by the &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; which was mined for the poems making up \r\n                            <ref type="apparatus" target="fragments_from_a_metrical_journal_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Fragments from a Metrical Journal&#x201D;</ref>, published in the gift annual&#x2014;is \r\n                            most directly represented in MS VIII by the displacement of draft of &#x201C;Account&#x201D; with draft of \r\n                            <ref type="apparatus" target="saltzburg_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Saltzburg&#x201D;</ref>, commissioned specifically to accompany an engraving for the annual. \r\n                            Perhaps Contents, section <hi rend="italic">e</hi> should likewise be understood as a new use for Ruskin of a rough&#x2010;draft notebook, \r\n                            a use focused less on generating draft for fair&#x2010;copy presentation within the family circle, and more on developing writing for publication. \r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>If so, the question arises of the subsequent relation between public and private writing in MS VIII. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> editors associated sections <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> \r\n                            with <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> alleged crush on <persName corresp="#ACD">Ad&#x00E8;le Domecq</persName>, based on his story in <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi>, which frames this infatuation in terms of poetic \r\n                            composition. To understand these sections of MS VIII more clearly, this lyric writing from <date when="1835">1835</date> and beyond needs, like &#x201C;Account,&#x201D; to be detached from its autobiographical coloring, \r\n                            and set in relation to the material culture of the <date notBefore="1830" notAfter="1839">1830s</date>. Connected with these questions may be the phenomenon of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> unusally protracted use of MS VIII, \r\n                            extending perhaps as late as <date when="1838">1838</date>.\r\n                        </p>\r\n                        <p>Other work that engaged <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> simultaneously with MS VIII, in addition to the fair&#x2010;copy manuscripts already mentioned, include \r\n                            the <ref type="apparatus" target="sermons_on_the_pentateuch.php">Sermons on the Pentateuch</ref> (MSS IIA&#x2010;E), composed and fair&#x2010;copied <date when="1832">1832</date> through <date when="1834">1834</date>, and \r\n                            the Mineralogical Dictionary (MS IVD), compiled <date when="1831">1831</date> through <date when="1836">1836</date>.

Correspondingly, poets advanced a poetics \r\n                    that singled out an audience of the fit though few. This economy changed abruptly with industrial improvements that cheapened paper as well as making mass print runs possible through stereotyping. \r\n                    Now publishers encouraged a variety of genres, especially prose genres, in order to appeal to an audience expanding in both numbers and breadth of social class \r\n                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY">Erickson, <hi rend="italic">Economy of Literary Form</hi></ref>, 19&#x2013;48). \r\n                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, for all his refinement, elitism, and perfectionism&#x2014;indeed, in a certain respect by virtue of those traits&#x2014;was able \r\n                    to maintain the viability of his poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, by responding to the growing popular market \r\n                    as an entrepreneur.

it is clear that the writer is unwilling to relinquish the paradigm of loss of childhood, since it sponsors Wordsworth&#x02BC;s \r\n                    paradigm of recompense. The reviewer is consoled that the imaginative experience of literature in childhood forms an inalienable part of the psychological and spiritual self, \r\n                    because this formation is overseen by a Wordsworthian &#x201C;literature of power&#x201D; that insists on the child&#x02BC;s subordination: \r\n                    &#x201C;[I]t is impossible to calculate how enormous in moulding the mind is the power of infant literature. \r\n                    It is not merely that what we read in childhood we never forget, but that it becomes part of our very being.&#x201D; &#x201C;Infant literature&#x201D; means writing <hi rend="italic">for</hi> children by adults, \r\n                    not writing <hi rend="italic">by</hi> children.

\r\n                    from which escapes, to the great good of the producer, the balderdash engendered, like a bad gas, by the active forces of youth.&#x201D; \r\n                    The child writer, instead of trailing clouds of glory, emits fatuous imagination&#x2014;the advantage of such flights being that, in an age of steam, \r\n                    early printing at least allows for regulation of the excess energy, as in an engine. \r\n                    For according to the &#x201C;economy of Nature&#x201D; in an industrial age, when poets can begin publishing at age fourteen, &#x201C;the more genius there is in any youthful brain \r\n                    the more nonsense&#x201D; there is to be &#x201C;got rid of&#x201D;; and as an additional benefit to the nation, early printing purges the child writer&#x02BC;s impressionable imitations of others. \r\n                    Just as <persName corresp="#ACS">Swinburne&#x02BC;s</persName> infant critic recognizes, &#x201C;on taking up the little book [by <persName corresp="#CJW">Wells</persName>] again in after years,&#x201D;

In this letter, he was also using pen and ink for the first time, which <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> says that he was \r\n                        &#x201C;much delighted at being able to use.&#x201D; He copied the two poems, \r\n                        unlike the text of the letter, entirely in ink, although in a print, not cursive hand \r\n                        (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RFL">Burd, ed., <hi rend="italic">Ruskin Family Letters</hi></ref>, 156, 127&#x2013;28, 157 n. 4).  \r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Facsimile and transcript by permission of Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                </div>\r\n                <div type="section" xml:id="DATE">\r\n                    <head type="section">Date</head>\r\n                    <p><date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> or possibly somewhat earlier. Evidence is contradictory in determining which is the earlier of the two pairs of \r\n                        <title type="poem" corresp="#WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#SPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Spring&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;the \r\n                        <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> version or the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. \r\n                        The greater assurance with which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to handle a pen and ink, along with the suggestiveness of some variants, \r\n                        points to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> as the later version: e.g., in line 8 of <title type="poem" corresp="#WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title>, \r\n                        a possibly overwritten alteration in punctuation in the <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> version \r\n                        is confirmed in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, indicating the latter as the secondary version. Similarly, in <title type="poem" corresp="#SPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Spring&#x201D;</title>, \r\n                        an addition above line 1 in <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> is duly incorporated into <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, \r\n                        and the that version contains a new phrase at line 14, which is not present in <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date>. \r\n                        At the same time, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version is uncharacteristically marred by grammatical and spelling errors that do not appear \r\n                        in the <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> version.

The \r\n                        primary function of the fears expressed in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s poem may well have been to help to forge identity in this Scottish&#x2010;English and, at this time, Dissenter household.\r\n                    </p> \r\n                    <p><persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> presumably picked up on these alarms in his parents, each \r\n                        of whom is likely to have communicated them, perhaps <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName> even more so than <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName>.

Finally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> clenches these revolutions \r\n                        with an original contribution&#x2014;the picture of a chain that an engine has forged &#x201C;link to link&#x201D; and impressed with a floral design like a bracelet.</p>\r\n                    <p>Formally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> borrows <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s heroic couplets without the pomposity of what \r\n                        <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName> condemns in the preface to <title type="anthology" corresp="#LYRICALBALLADS"><hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi></title> \r\n                        as the artifice of poetic diction. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> catches <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s livelier rhyme words, \r\n                        and the poet&#x02BC;s energy and exuberance. Of course, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may simply have avoided a learnedness of diction that he did not understand \r\n                        at his young age; he shows a similar preference for poetic over pedantic terms in his\r\n                        adaptation of <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCIENTIFICDIALOGUES">Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></ref>,\r\n                        in <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>. But <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                        liked unusual words that could energize his writing; and perhaps the appeal for him of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry lay \r\n                        in the extraordinary fertility with which the poet invented words&#x2014;a major factor in the success of \r\n                        <title type="poem" corresp="BOTANICGARDEN"><hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi></title>, as suggested by <persName corresp="#DGK">D.

In <title type="poem" corresp="#THESTORM">&#x201C;The storm&#x201D;</title>, \r\n                        strophe (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) appears to start the poem anew and revise (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>); and as an indication that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                        meant strophe (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to replace (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), he wrote the word \r\n                        &#x201C;bad&#x201D; on the same line as the runover of the final line of (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), as if declaring that strophe rejected. Little\r\n                        time appears to have elapsed between this decision and the composition of (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), the\r\n                        hand remaining consistent; and the immediacy of this revision perhaps explains why <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not repeat the title, \r\n                        as if considering the original title to remain in play.</p>\r\n                    <p>While the meaning of <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> may be open to interpretation, I have marked it as a metamark&#x2014;not a part of the poem \r\n                        itself, but as disapproving comment on strophe (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>]),\r\n                        prompting the composition of (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) as a replacement. The most obvious evidence\r\n                        for this interpretation is that the runover line becomes jibberish (&#x0201C;light bad nings&#x0201D;) if one treats <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> as part of the line itself. \r\n                        Other evidence for treating the word as a separable metamark is the\r\n                        physical alignment of the runovers of the final two lines, which, if <hi rend="bad">bad</hi> is omitted, appears in keeping with that of other poems\r\n                        in the anthology.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div type="section" xml:id="DISCUSSION">\r\n                    <head type="section">Discussion</head>\r\n                    <p>If <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> is read as a judgment on strophe (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>),\r\n                        one quality that may explain the rejection is the violence of the woman&#x2019;s\r\n                        death in that version of the poem. In other very early work, there is evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s avoiding expression of \r\n                        violence.

For example, in <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote to his father: \r\n                    &#x201C;I am trying to get that red book of mine which has the Monastery in it finished, by the time you come home,&#x201D; \r\n                    referring both to <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref> and to \r\n                    a work, <ref type="apparatus" target="the_monastery_apparatus.php">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</ref>, included in the notebook. \r\n                    The work, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> versification of the novel by <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, is not the most prominent piece contained in the Red Book, \r\n                    but it happened to be uppermost in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> mind at the time.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>In many of the initially blank, bound notebooks and ledgers that Ruskin typically used to draft or fair copy his work&#x2014;he \r\n                    also used loose sheets of paper, or pamphlets folded and sewn by hand \r\n                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="overview_of_mss_note.php">Overview of Manuscripts</ref>)&#x2014;he dedicated the notebook initially to a major work, \r\n                    for which he devised a decorated title page. \r\n                    For example, <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php">MS I</ref>, \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref>, and \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiiia_apparatus.php">MS IIIA</ref>, begin with volumes 1, 2, and 3, \r\n                    respectively, of <title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy.&#x201D;</title> Presumably, in these cases, \r\n                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> referred to the manuscript by the title of its major work, using that title interchangeably \r\n                    for the text of the work and for the physical manuscript witnessing its fair copy. \r\n                    Thus, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> announces in a <date when="1832-01-14">14 January 1832</date> letter that <title type="poem" corresp="#ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> is at last finished, quite copied in, fairly dismissed,&#x201D; \r\n                    and that he has &#x201C;put such a finis&#x201D; with &#x201C;innumerable flourishes with which it is decorated and the paper loaded \r\n                    you would think there never was to be a beginning of that end,&#x201D; he clearly means that he has &#x201C;copied in&#x201D; the work, \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref>, into the bound notebook that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> would later designate as \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php">MS VII</ref>, and &#x201C;decorated&#x201D; and &#x201C;loaded&#x201D; the &#x201C;paper&#x201D; of the physical object in order to celebrate \r\n                    completion of the text of the poem. The title &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D; applied equally to the text of the poem and to its fair-copy manuscript.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>Such coterminous titles could not have been stable, however. We do not know what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> called the notebook containing the fair copy of \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref> when, over time, he subjected this notebook, \r\n                    like so many of his manuscripts, to additional uses. In this case, he followed \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref> in \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php">MS VII</ref> with a fair copy of a new, but never-completed epic poem, \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="athens_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#ATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title></ref>. Later, still more works were fair-copied into this ledger. \r\n                    Titles of manuscripts could shift with their uses. The handmade pamphlet now known as \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus">MS II</ref> shows &#x201C;Vol 1&#x201D; scrawled on the top right corner of its first recto. \r\n                    The designation appears as an afterthought, inserted into a space next to the title of the first poem \r\n                    of this little anthology. What the name of the manuscript means is obscure: other, complementary &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; may have existed, \r\n                    but it is just as likely that the pamphlet only temporarily occupied the position of first in a putative series that remained only an idea.\r\n                </p> \r\n                <p>Titles could also be kept deliberately open-ended. On the first blank recto of the notebook now known as <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.php">MS V</ref>, \r\n                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote the heading, &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry,&#x201D; and numbered this recto as page 1. As a title for the anthology of poems contained in the notebook, \r\n                    &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry&#x201D; became intriguingly coterminous for both the text of the anthology and for the physical notebook containing the text, \r\n                    when Ruskin&#x02BC;s father inserted below <persName corresp="#JR">John&#x02BC;s</persName> title the attribution, \r\n                    &#x201C;By <persName corresp="#JR">J.

Thus, the collaborative title&#x2014;along with the text of the anthology&#x2014;remained open-ended, \r\n                    as the text advanced toward the physical limits \r\n                    of the notebook that defined the scope of the anthology. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> never completed his portion of the title \r\n                    because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> never filled the notebook&#x2014;the unpunctuated \r\n                    final line, &#x201C;Away and away,&#x201D;
