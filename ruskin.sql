As he relayed these legends, the sacristan recalled how he had helped \r\n                    attend <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> and <persName corresp="#JDB">Josephine</persName> in their tour of the cathedral. Allowing <persName corresp="#FMT">Mrs. Trollope</persName> to ascend and seat herself on the throne, the sacristan told her how <persName corresp="#JDB">Josephine</persName> had \r\n                    likewise indulged in that honor, whereas <persName corresp="#NBE">Napoleon</persName> reverently avoided touching any of these relics of the <placeName corresp="#HOLYROMANEMPIRE">Holy Roman Empire</placeName> or stepping on the stone covering <persName corresp="#CHARLEMAGNE">Charlemagne</persName>&#x02BC;s tomb \r\n                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#TROLLOPEBELGIUM">Trollope, <hi rend="italic">Belgium and Western Germany in 1833</hi></ref>, 1:108&#x2013;11). \r\n                    For a shrewder account of this anecdote by a Swiss guard of the cathedral, see the <date when="1828">1828</date> travel narrative by <persName corresp="#SJB">John Barrow</persName> (<date notBefore="1764" notAfter="1848">1764&#x2013;1848</date>), \r\n                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BARROWFAMILYTOUR"><hi rend="italic">A Family Tour through South Holland</hi></ref> (p. 232).</note>\r\n                \r\n                <note xml:id="ITHINKGLOSS" resp="#DCH">&#x201C;Last judgment.

This opening declaration in the &#x201C;Date&#x201D; section \r\n                    is followed by a discussion of the evidence for dating the work. The choice of date for indexing purposes awards priority to a date inscribed in the manuscript \r\n                    by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself or by his parents, if that date is reasonably trustworthy; otherwise, the opening declaration uses a date or date range of composition.</p>\r\n                <p>The date thus selected for indexing purposes is somewhat arbitrary since, as the discussion in the &#x201C;Date&#x201D; section of an apparatus clarifies in any given instance,\r\n                    the date that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> or his parents inscribed may refer to a variety of stages in the composition, specifying possibly when he wrote a work, or when he fair&#x2010;copied it, \r\n                    or the occasion when he presented it to a recipient. For example, a date of &#x201C;<date when="1828-01-01">1 January 1828</date>&#x201D; that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> inscribed on a\r\n                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="new_years_poems_note.php">New Year&#x02BC;s Poem</ref> refers obviously to the occasion of the fair copy&#x02BC;s presentation, \r\n                    and <date when="1828-01-01">1 January 1828</date> is used to index the poem in the archive. In such an instance, as the discussion of a work will clarify, however, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> would typically have drafted and fair&#x2010;copied\r\n                    the poem in <date notBefore="1827-12-01" notAfter="1827-12-31">December 1827</date>.</p>\r\n                <p>For indexing purposes, less credence is apt to be awarded to dates inscribed in the manuscript by later hands&#x2014;typically by\r\n                    <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="wedderburn_note.php"><persName corresp="#AW">Alexander Wedderburn</persName> (d. <date when="1931">1931</date>)</ref> \r\n                    or <ref type="note" subtype="biographical" target="collingwood_w_g_note.php"><persName corresp="#WGC">W.

If these dates are questionable, \r\n                    the inscription is merely mentioned and discussed in the &#x201C;Date&#x201D; section.</p>\r\n                <p>In some cases, even dates that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> himself inscribed can be very misleading. For example, he dated several poems in <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref> \r\n                    as <date when="1829-03-09">9 March 1829</date>. He is unlikely to have composed, or even fair&#x2010;copied, so many poems in a single day. This may be a case in which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s inscription of a date \r\n                    refers, rather, to a wished&#x2010;for date of fair&#x2010;copying, a performative episode turning on tensions arising from his parents&#x02BC; attempts to control his writing, \r\n                    in conflict with his ardent desire to please them with his compositions \r\n                    (see <ref type="apparatus" target="of_rocks_first_apparatus.php#DISCUSSION.php">&#x201C;Of rocks first and of caverns now I sing&#x201D;: Discussion</ref>).</p>\r\n                <p>The compositional date is given&#x2014;and the piece is ordered sequentially\r\n                    within a given year, according to that date&#x2014;only when a datable\r\n                    rough draft or some other hard evidence about its composition is available. In\r\n                    cases for which only the fair copy remains, one may often assume only a few\r\n                    months, at most, to have elapsed between beginning composition and\r\n                    fair&#x2010;copying. Parts of some longer poems such\r\n                    as <ref type="apparatus" target="eudosia_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#RUSKINEUDOSIA">&#x201C;Eudosia&#x201D;</title></ref> appear, in fact, to have been\r\n                    fair&#x2010;copied almost as soon as <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> drafted them. Such assumptions\r\n                    are not uniformly safe, however, since <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s anthologies include\r\n                    poems that good evidence may date as much as a year earlier than when he\r\n                    compiled the anthology.</p> \r\n            </div>\r\n        </body>\r\n    ', 'url'),

Our aim in encoding and describing corpora is \r\n                        to express the forms taken by Ruskin&#x02BC;s anthologizing impulse, \r\n                        while complying with the TEI standards for XML \r\n                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology</ref>).\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Listed in the Corpora Index are titles of projects that Ruskin clearly developed as distinct corpora. The list includes titles that overlap with some \r\n                        found in the Works Indices, since Ruskin conceived of some groups of texts as a single composite <hi rend="italic">work</hi>. Other titles in the Corpora Index are nearly coterminous \r\n                        with titles found in the Manuscripts Index, Ruskin sometimes using the physical boundaries of a major manuscript to help define a corpus. \r\n                        Indeed, in the encoding procedures of <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, \r\n                        any major manuscript forms a kind of corpus, albeit a miscellaneous one, and can itself be made up of other corpora. Listed here, however, \r\n                        are manuscripts that Ruskin identified as distinct anthologies or composites.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Titles of copora default to an Apparatus Page, which in some cases is identical to a Work Apparatus, but which in other cases such as anthologies assembles \r\n                        information unique to a collection (e.g., title, contents, date, organizing themes, and other discussion).

Erased earlier numbering remains\r\n                    visible starting on the present p. 21 (&#x201C;19&#x201D; is the erased\r\n                    number, an error since p. 19 had already appeared) and continuing consecutively\r\n                    through p. 49[<hi rend="italic">b</hi>] (i.e., the <hi rend="italic">second</hi>\r\n                    p. 49). Since the latter was written over top of &#x201C;47,&#x201D; it\r\n                    appears that, at about this point, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> realized an error, went back to the\r\n                    present p. 21, and began renumbering; however, he made some new errors and\r\n                    possibly deliberately repeated pp. 48&#x2013;49 in an attempt to bring his\r\n                    numbering in sync with following pages.

It appears that the deleted phrase originally formed part of a colophon that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> meant to apply only to the poetry anthology, \r\n                    but that, by deleting the phrase, he caused to refer to the entire Red Book, not just the\r\n                    poems (reading, in effect, &#x201C;The end / <placeName corresp="#HERNE">hernhill</placeName> / <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName> / juvenile library <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName>&#x201D;). Another, slightly different scenario is possible: the fact that the final two\r\n                    poems of the anthology fall after <persName corresp="#MR">Margaret</persName>&#x02BC;s annotation dating the whole of\r\n                    MS I may indicate that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> added these poems (on pp.\r\n                    103&#x2013;6) after his <persName corresp="#MR">mother</persName>&#x02BC;s dating, and as he did so, he deleted &#x201C;end of\r\n                    the poems&#x201D; on p. 106 so as not to belie his addition. But this possibility seems contradicted by the placement of the colophon following all of the poems. \r\n                    It is also possible, of course, whatever the scenario, that the deletion was not made by <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>, but by someone\r\n                    else.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div type="subsection" xml:id="DOMESTICSCENE">\r\n                <head type="subsection">Domestic Scene</head>\r\n                <p>MS I is the only <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> to locate\r\n                    its imaginary publisher, the &#x201C;juvenile library,&#x201D; in\r\n                    &#x201C;<placeName corresp="#HERNE">hernhill</placeName> / <placeName corresp="#FOUNTAINST">fountain street</placeName>,&#x201D; other Red Books mentioning simply <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="herne_hill_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName></ref>. \r\n                    Could <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> be referring to what <hi rend="italic">Praeterita</hi> records as an early memory, the water\r\n                    carts being filled in front of the house (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRWORKSLE">Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Works</hi></ref>, 35:21)?\r\n                    In <hi rend="italic">Praeterita,</hi> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> leaves unclear whether he observed\r\n                    the carts from the windows of <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Hern Hill</placeName> or of the <ref type="note" subtype="geographical" target="hunter_street_note.php"><placeName corresp="#HUNTERST">Hunter Street</placeName></ref>\r\n                    house&#x2014;where the family lived prior to <placeName corresp="#HERNE">Herne Hill</placeName>, until <date when="1823-03">March 1823</date>\r\n                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#RUSKINSCAMBERWELL">Dearden, <hi rend="italic">Ruskin&#x02BC;s Camberwell</hi></ref>, 1).

Correspondingly, poets advanced a poetics \r\n                    that singled out an audience of the fit though few. This economy changed abruptly with industrial improvements that cheapened paper as well as making mass print runs possible through stereotyping. \r\n                    Now publishers encouraged a variety of genres, especially prose genres, in order to appeal to an audience expanding in both numbers and breadth of social class \r\n                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY">Erickson, <hi rend="italic">Economy of Literary Form</hi></ref>, 19&#x2013;48). \r\n                    <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>, for all his refinement, elitism, and perfectionism&#x2014;indeed, in a certain respect by virtue of those traits&#x2014;was able \r\n                    to maintain the viability of his poem, <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, by responding to the growing popular market \r\n                    as an entrepreneur. He did so by capitalizing on another technological innovation of the period, steel engraving, which made possible the mass production of the engraved image, \r\n                    and which in <persName corresp="#LE">Erickson</persName>&#x02BC;s view deflected what remained of the popular poetry market into the minor subgenre of light lyric, pictorial verse favored by the \r\n                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="annuals_note.php">Annuals and Other Illustrated Books</ref> \r\n                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#ERICKSONECONOMY">Erickson, <hi rend="italic">Economy of Literary Form</hi></ref>, 29&#x2013;31). The medium \r\n                    made possible two of the most widely distributed and steadily demanded illustrated books of the first half of the century, the \r\n                    <date when="1830">1830</date> illustrated edition of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>, and the \r\n                    <date when="1834">1834</date> collected <title type="book" corresp="#ROGERSPOEMS1834"><hi rend="italic">Poems</hi></title>.</p>\r\n                <p>While this achievement was owing to <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s unusual ability to manage the fortunes of his poetry in revolutionary market conditions, \r\n                    and to sustain at least the appearance of elite consumer status attached to his poetry, the possibility that conditions of print and visual culture equally governed \r\n                    the reception of his poetry is suggested by the most ephemeral of the illustrated versions of <title type="poem" corresp="#ROGERSITALY"><hi rend="italic">Italy</hi></title>. \r\n                    In <date notBefore="1824-10" notAfter="1824-11">late 1824</date>, there appeared a version of part 1 of the poem, with 12 copper engravings by <persName corresp="#TSP">Stothard</persName>, \r\n                    published as the <title type="periodical" corresp="#ROYALENGAGEMENTPOCKETATLAS"><hi rend="italic">Royal Engagement Pocket Atlas</hi></title> for <date when="1825">1825</date>  \r\n                    (see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#POWELLTURNERSVIGNETTES">Powell, &#x201C;Turner&#x02BC;s Vignettes&#x201D;</ref>, 2; and \r\n                    <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#HOLCOMBCLASSICALTURNER">Holcomb, &#x201C;Neglected Classical Phase of Turner&#x02BC;s Art&#x201D;</ref>, 406 n. 2). \r\n                    This was not an edition of <persName corresp="#SR">Rogers</persName>&#x02BC;s complete poem, but an adaptation accommodated to the printed artifact called a <hi rend="italic">pocket book</hi>, \r\n                    which was an ephemeral publication combining features of an annual almanac with a diary or engagement calendar.

Evidence is contradictory in determining which is the earlier of the two pairs of \r\n                        <title type="poem" corresp="#WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title> and <title type="poem" corresp="#SPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Spring&#x201D;</title>&#x2014;the \r\n                        <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> version or the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version. \r\n                        The greater assurance with which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> appears to handle a pen and ink, along with the suggestiveness of some variants, \r\n                        points to <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> as the later version: e.g., in line 8 of <title type="poem" corresp="#WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title>, \r\n                        a possibly overwritten alteration in punctuation in the <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> version \r\n                        is confirmed in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, indicating the latter as the secondary version. Similarly, in <title type="poem" corresp="#SPRINGBLANKVERSE">&#x201C;Spring&#x201D;</title>, \r\n                        an addition above line 1 in <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> is duly incorporated into <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, \r\n                        and the that version contains a new phrase at line 14, which is not present in <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date>. \r\n                        At the same time, the <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version is uncharacteristically marred by grammatical and spelling errors that do not appear \r\n                        in the <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> version. It is unlike <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> to introduce errors in a subsequent copy. \r\n                        (See the glosses attached to the two transcriptions.)</p>\r\n                    <p>Oddest of all is <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s employment of the term <hi rend="italic">nectron</hi> in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>, \r\n                        an unusual form as compared with the more familiar \r\n                        <hi rend="italic">nectarine</hi> used in the <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> version. Complicating this word choice, in <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> \r\n                        also contains one occurrence of <hi rend="italic">nectron</hi>, which <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> scores through and replaces with <hi rend="italic">nectarine</hi>. \r\n                        It seems equally plausible, therefore, to treat <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> as a later version that \r\n                        corrects word choice and grammatical, punctuation, and spelling errors found in <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title>. Or perhaps the two versions \r\n                        are independent copies deriving from a third, prior version, now lost.</p>\r\n                    <p>See also <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="date_citation_note.php">System of Date Citation</ref>.</p>\r\n                    \r\n                </div>\r\n                <div type="section" xml:id="COMPPUB">\r\n                    <head type="section">Composition and Publication</head>\r\n                    <p>The <title type="manuscript" corresp="#MSIII">MS III</title> version has not been previously published.</p>\r\n                    <p>For the provenance and publication history of the <date when="1827-05">May 1827</date> version, see \r\n                        <ref type="apparatus" target="wales_apparatus.php#COMPPUB"><title type="poem" corresp="#WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title>: Composition and Publication</ref>. \r\n                        This version, like that of <title type="poem" corresp="#WALES">&#x201C;Wales&#x201D;</title>, published with entirety of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s letter, \r\n                        in <title type="collected_letters" corresp="#JRLETTERS">&#x201C;Letters of John Ruskin&#x201D;</title>, \r\n                        volumes 93&#x2013;94 (<date when="1904">1904</date>) of the <title type="periodical" rend="italic" corresp="ATLANTICMONTHLY">Atlantic Monthly</title> \r\n                        (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#JRLETTERS">&#x201C;Letters of John Ruskin,&#x201D; ed.

Finally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> clenches these revolutions \r\n                        with an original contribution&#x2014;the picture of a chain that an engine has forged &#x201C;link to link&#x201D; and impressed with a floral design like a bracelet.</p>\r\n                    <p>Formally, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> borrows <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s heroic couplets without the pomposity of what \r\n                        <persName corresp="#WW">Wordsworth</persName> condemns in the preface to <title type="anthology" corresp="#LYRICALBALLADS"><hi rend="italic">Lyrical Ballads</hi></title> \r\n                        as the artifice of poetic diction. <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> catches <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s livelier rhyme words, \r\n                        and the poet&#x02BC;s energy and exuberance. Of course, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> may simply have avoided a learnedness of diction that he did not understand \r\n                        at his young age; he shows a similar preference for poetic over pedantic terms in his\r\n                        adaptation of <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SCIENTIFICDIALOGUES">Joyce, <hi rend="italic">Scientific Dialogues</hi></ref>,\r\n                        in <ref type="apparatus" target="harry_and_lucy_vol1_apparatus.php">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy,&#x201D; Vol. 1</ref>. But <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                        liked unusual words that could energize his writing; and perhaps the appeal for him of <persName corresp="#ED">Darwin</persName>&#x02BC;s poetry lay \r\n                        in the extraordinary fertility with which the poet invented words&#x2014;a major factor in the success of \r\n                        <title type="poem" corresp="BOTANICGARDEN"><hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden</hi></title>, as suggested by <persName corresp="#DGK">D.

In <title type="poem" corresp="#THESTORM">&#x201C;The storm&#x201D;</title>, \r\n                        strophe (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) appears to start the poem anew and revise (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>); and as an indication that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> \r\n                        meant strophe (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) to replace (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), he wrote the word \r\n                        &#x201C;bad&#x201D; on the same line as the runover of the final line of (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>), as if declaring that strophe rejected. Little\r\n                        time appears to have elapsed between this decision and the composition of (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), the\r\n                        hand remaining consistent; and the immediacy of this revision perhaps explains why <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not repeat the title, \r\n                        as if considering the original title to remain in play.</p>\r\n                    <p>While the meaning of <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> may be open to interpretation, I have marked it as a metamark&#x2014;not a part of the poem \r\n                        itself, but as disapproving comment on strophe (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>]),\r\n                        prompting the composition of (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) as a replacement. The most obvious evidence\r\n                        for this interpretation is that the runover line becomes jibberish (&#x0201C;light bad nings&#x0201D;) if one treats <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> as part of the line itself. \r\n                        Other evidence for treating the word as a separable metamark is the\r\n                        physical alignment of the runovers of the final two lines, which, if <hi rend="bad">bad</hi> is omitted, appears in keeping with that of other poems\r\n                        in the anthology.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div type="section" xml:id="DISCUSSION">\r\n                    <head type="section">Discussion</head>\r\n                    <p>If <hi rend="italic">bad</hi> is read as a judgment on strophe (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>),\r\n                        one quality that may explain the rejection is the violence of the woman&#x2019;s\r\n                        death in that version of the poem. In other very early work, there is evidence of <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName>&#x02BC;s avoiding expression of \r\n                        violence.

For example, in <date when="1829-03">March 1829</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote to his father: \r\n                    &#x201C;I am trying to get that red book of mine which has the Monastery in it finished, by the time you come home,&#x201D; \r\n                    referring both to <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref> and to \r\n                    a work, <ref type="apparatus" target="the_monastery_apparatus.php">&#x201C;The Monastery&#x201D;</ref>, included in the notebook. \r\n                    The work, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> versification of the novel by <persName corresp="#WS">Walter Scott</persName>, is not the most prominent piece contained in the Red Book, \r\n                    but it happened to be uppermost in <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> mind at the time.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>In many of the initially blank, bound notebooks and ledgers that Ruskin typically used to draft or fair copy his work&#x2014;he \r\n                    also used loose sheets of paper, or pamphlets folded and sewn by hand \r\n                    (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="overview_of_mss_note.php">Overview of Manuscripts</ref>)&#x2014;he dedicated the notebook initially to a major work, \r\n                    for which he devised a decorated title page. \r\n                    For example, <ref type="apparatus" target="msi_apparatus.php">MS I</ref>, \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiii_apparatus.php">MS III</ref>, and \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msiiia_apparatus.php">MS IIIA</ref>, begin with volumes 1, 2, and 3, \r\n                    respectively, of <title type="lesson" corresp="#HARRYANDLUCYVOL1">&#x201C;Harry and Lucy.&#x201D;</title> Presumably, in these cases, \r\n                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> referred to the manuscript by the title of its major work, using that title interchangeably \r\n                    for the text of the work and for the physical manuscript witnessing its fair copy. \r\n                    Thus, when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> announces in a <date when="1832-01-14">14 January 1832</date> letter that <title type="poem" corresp="#ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title> is at last finished, quite copied in, fairly dismissed,&#x201D; \r\n                    and that he has &#x201C;put such a finis&#x201D; with &#x201C;innumerable flourishes with which it is decorated and the paper loaded \r\n                    you would think there never was to be a beginning of that end,&#x201D; he clearly means that he has &#x201C;copied in&#x201D; the work, \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref>, into the bound notebook that <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood</persName> would later designate as \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php">MS VII</ref>, and &#x201C;decorated&#x201D; and &#x201C;loaded&#x201D; the &#x201C;paper&#x201D; of the physical object in order to celebrate \r\n                    completion of the text of the poem. The title &#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D; applied equally to the text of the poem and to its fair-copy manuscript.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>Such coterminous titles could not have been stable, however. We do not know what <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> called the notebook containing the fair copy of \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref> when, over time, he subjected this notebook, \r\n                    like so many of his manuscripts, to additional uses. In this case, he followed \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="iteriad_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#ITERIAD">&#x201C;Iteriad&#x201D;</title></ref> in \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msvii_apparatus.php">MS VII</ref> with a fair copy of a new, but never-completed epic poem, \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="athens_apparatus.php"><title type="poem" corresp="#ATHENS">&#x201C;Athens&#x201D;</title></ref>. Later, still more works were fair-copied into this ledger. \r\n                    Titles of manuscripts could shift with their uses. The handmade pamphlet now known as \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msii_apparatus">MS II</ref> shows &#x201C;Vol 1&#x201D; scrawled on the top right corner of its first recto. \r\n                    The designation appears as an afterthought, inserted into a space next to the title of the first poem \r\n                    of this little anthology. What the name of the manuscript means is obscure: other, complementary &#x201C;volumes&#x201D; may have existed, \r\n                    but it is just as likely that the pamphlet only temporarily occupied the position of first in a putative series that remained only an idea.\r\n                </p> \r\n                <p>Titles could also be kept deliberately open-ended. On the first blank recto of the notebook now known as <ref type="apparatus" target="msv_apparatus.php">MS V</ref>, \r\n                    <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> wrote the heading, &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry,&#x201D; and numbered this recto as page 1. As a title for the anthology of poems contained in the notebook, \r\n                    &#x201C;Miscellaneous Poetry&#x201D; became intriguingly coterminous for both the text of the anthology and for the physical notebook containing the text, \r\n                    when Ruskin&#x02BC;s father inserted below <persName corresp="#JR">John&#x02BC;s</persName> title the attribution, \r\n                    &#x201C;By <persName corresp="#JR">J.

Thus, the collaborative title&#x2014;along with the text of the anthology&#x2014;remained open-ended, \r\n                    as the text advanced toward the physical limits \r\n                    of the notebook that defined the scope of the anthology. <persName corresp="#JJR">John James</persName> never completed his portion of the title \r\n                    because <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> never filled the notebook&#x2014;the unpunctuated \r\n                    final line, &#x201C;Away and away,&#x201D; of the last poem added to the anthology trailing off into the blankness of remaining pages.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>Even when <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin&#x02BC;s</persName> usage of a title is documented consistently over time, \r\n                    the evidence may be unclear to what the title refers. \r\n                    In letters of <date when="1832">1832</date> and <date when="1835">1835</date>, <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> mentioned his &#x201C;mineralogical dictionary,&#x201D; \r\n                    and both the title and (roughly) the dates of composition held good decades later, \r\n                    when in <date when="1864">1864</date> <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> referred to having &#x201C;written a <title type="reference" corresp="#MINERALOGICALDICTIONARY"><hi rend="italic">Mineralogical Dictionary</hi></title>,&#x201D;

(<persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> wanted nothing to do with <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> insertions, so she ignored their assignation of &#x201C;MS IA&#x201D; \r\n                    to the collection of manuscripts that they bound under that name, and instead assigned &#x201C;MS IA&#x201D; to the manuscript of &#x201C;The Puppet Show,&#x201D; which <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn</persName> \r\n                    called &#x201C;MS IB.&#x201D;)\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>Whatever the other merits of <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> &#x201C;Dating MSS. of Boyhood,&#x201D; her solution for naming and numbering manuscripts fails to lend clarity to what \r\n                    was already a losing proposition of ordering objects linearly that <persName corresp="#JR">Ruskin</persName> did not use in that fashion. \r\n                    He protracted use of some manuscripts over several years, \r\n                    and he overwrote others, building up layers of chronological sequence within a given manuscript. \r\n                    Fortunately, electronic publication provides alternatives to linear ordering \r\n                    (see <ref type="note" target="plan_of_archive">Plan of the Archive</ref>).\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>As for <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> and <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> accretions of manuscript designations to <persName corresp="#WGC">Collingwood&#x02BC;s</persName> &#x201C;Note,&#x201D; \r\n                    the practice in <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> is, in any case, to document fully as possible the history of naming manuscripts and works in the &#x201C;Title&#x201D; sections \r\n                    of apparatuses, while for hyperlinking purposes to use short titles for which a clear trail exists in bibliography and scholarship. \r\n                    Therefore, manuscripts are designated by Roman numeral if they were assigned one either in Collingwood&#x02BC;s &#x201C;Note,&#x201D; \r\n                    or in <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> revision of the &#x201C;Note&#x201D; for the \r\n                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="library_edition_note.xml">Library Edition</ref>. \r\n                    Since <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> additional Roman-numeral designations (and even <hi rend="italic">re</hi>designation, in one case) were never published, \r\n                    <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> prefers the short discursive titles established in <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> bibliography (III.B.<hi rend="italic">b</hi>), \r\n                    titles that typically are also reflected in the provenance of modern bindings, sales catalogs, and library catalogs for the collections that ultimately \r\n                    preserved these manuscripts.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>An exception is \r\n                    <ref type="apparatus" target="msjc_apparatus">MS IIIA</ref>, for which <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi> accepts <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen&#x02BC;s</persName> title. \r\n                    Although its provenance can be traced in \r\n                    <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="provenance_sothebys_1930_note.php">Sotheby&#x02BC;s Sale of Ruskin Manuscripts and Library, 1930</ref>, \r\n                    this <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="red_book_note.php">Red Book</ref> was not listed or named in <persName corresp="#ETC">Cook</persName> and <persName corresp="#AW">Wedderburn&#x02BC;s</persName> bibliography, \r\n                    and <persName corresp="#HGV">Viljoen</persName> appears to have been the first to name the manuscript.\r\n                </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n        </body>\r\n    ', 'url'),
