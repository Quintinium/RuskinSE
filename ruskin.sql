To a people influenced by these considerations, the restoration of a free trade, [and] \r\n                    the respite from that anxiety and suspense which the prosecution of a war never fails to engender, . . . were advantages that sweetened the bitter draught \r\n                    of a dishonourable treaty, and induced the majority of the nation to acquiesce in the peace, not barely without murmuring, but even with some degree of satisfaction and applause&#x201D; \r\n                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#SMOLLETTHISTORYOFENGLAND">Smollett, <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi></ref>, 3:218&#x2013;19; \r\n                    and see <ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#GREENESMOLLETTTHEHISTORIAN">Greene, &#x201C;Smollett the Historian&#x201D;</ref>). \r\n                    <persName corresp="#JC">Colley</persName> looks to this kind of sentiment as evidence of her larger thesis that &#x201C;the relationship between the [British] trading interest on the one hand, and the landed \r\n                    interest that dominated the legislature and policy&#x2010;making on the other, though by no means an equal or an invariably tranquil one, was for much of the eighteenth century \r\n                    and afer mutually beneficial. Trade was not only an indispensable part of the British economy, but also vital for the state&#x02BC;s revenue and naval power. \r\n                    In return, traders depended on the state for the maintenance of civil order, for sympathetic legislation, for protection in peace and war, and for access to captive markets overseas.&#x201D; \r\n                    Although this mutually supportive relationship between land and trade was later frayed by the protracted <date notBefore="1799-11-09" notAfter="1815-06-18">Napoleonic conflict</date>, which was costly to British trade, \r\n                    the relationship was for many Britons the foundation of patriotism. This was especially the case for Tory Lowland Scots like the Ruskins, whose patriotism intensified \r\n                    following the failed invasion in <date when="1745">1745</date> by the Young Pretender, <persName corresp="#PCES">Prince Charles Edward Stuart</persName>, who was supported by Highland Scots. \r\n                    Both in the midst and in the aftermath of that crisis, <persName corresp="#JC">Colley</persName> argues, \r\n                    Jacobitism was defeated not only by British Protestantism and anti&#x2010;Catholic fervor but also by fear of civil war, apprehension of loss of lives and property, \r\n                    and the belief that successful Jacobitism would lend an advantage in trade to France \r\n                    (<ref type="bibliography" target="bibliography.php#BRITONS">Colley, <hi rend="italic">Britons</hi></ref>, 71, and see 71&#x2013;85). Thus, for British travelers, \r\n                    Continental sites commemorating peace treaties could stir patriotism, evoking not only military pride but also the mercantile interests that underlay that patriotism.</note>\r\n\r\n                <note xml:id="SPATOAIXGLOSS" resp="#DCH">&#x201C;If thou ever travellest from <placeName corresp="#SPA">Spa</placeName> to <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix</placeName>&#x201D; \r\n                    (MS VIII; MS IX; <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> [1903])&#x2014;In <date when="1833">1833</date>, this journey led from <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName> into <placeName corresp="#PRUSSIA">Prussia</placeName>, \r\n                    which had acquired <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</placeName> (<placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aachen</placeName>) in the <date when="1818">Congress of Vienna</date> (<date when="1815">1815</date>). \r\n                    After the revolution of <date when="1830">1830</date>, which created <placeName corresp="#BELGIUM">Belgium</placeName>, <placeName corresp="#AIXLACHAPELLE">Aix&#x2010;la&#x2010;Chapelle</placeName> lay at the tripoint joining the borders of that new nation, \r\n                    <placeName corresp="#PRUSSIA">Prussia</placeName>, and the <placeName corresp="#NETHERLANDS">Netherlands</placeName>.

Our aim in encoding and describing corpora is \r\n                        to express the forms taken by Ruskin&#x02BC;s anthologizing impulse, \r\n                        while complying with the TEI standards for XML \r\n                        (see <ref type="note" subtype="bibliographical" target="editorial_rationale_note.php">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology</ref>).\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Listed in the Corpora Index are titles of projects that Ruskin clearly developed as distinct corpora. The list includes titles that overlap with some \r\n                        found in the Works Indices, since Ruskin conceived of some groups of texts as a single composite <hi rend="italic">work</hi>. Other titles in the Corpora Index are nearly coterminous \r\n                        with titles found in the Manuscripts Index, Ruskin sometimes using the physical boundaries of a major manuscript to help define a corpus. \r\n                        Indeed, in the encoding procedures of <hi rend="italic">ERM</hi>, \r\n                        any major manuscript forms a kind of corpus, albeit a miscellaneous one, and can itself be made up of other corpora. Listed here, however, \r\n                        are manuscripts that Ruskin identified as distinct anthologies or composites.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <p>Titles of copora default to an Apparatus Page, which in some cases is identical to a Work Apparatus, but which in other cases such as anthologies assembles \r\n                        information unique to a collection (e.g., title, contents, date, organizing themes, and other discussion).
